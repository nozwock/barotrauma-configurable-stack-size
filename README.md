Configure the stack size of any in-game item via an editable config file. The 63-stack size limit is removed in Singleplayer but remains in Multiplayer. By default:

- Stackable "smallitems" have a stack size of 64 (32 in player inventory).
- Items like O2/fuel tanks remain unstackable in player inventory but stack to 64 elsewhere.
- Ammo and battery stacks are doubled in player inventory (e.g., 24 revolver rounds instead of 12).

All defaults are customizable in the config file.

## Requirements
- [Lua For Barotrauma](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2559634234) with "CSharp Scripting" enabled.

## Configuration
Launch the game once with the mod enabled to generate the default config in the `Barotrauma/WorkshopMods/Installed/3402019765/` directory. "Barotrauma" refers to the folder where your save files are stored.

In Multiplayer, only the hostâ€™s configuration is used and synced to players.

### Format

```json
"itemPatches": [
    {
        "applyOnlyToStackables": false,
        "tags": [ "mobilebattery", "handheldammo" ],
        "operations": [
            { "key": "MaxStackSize", "operation": "=", "value": "{maxStackSize}" },
            { "key": "MaxStackSizeCharacterInventory", "operation": "*", "value": 2 },
        ]
    }
],
"containerOptions": {
    "maxStackSize": 64,
    "characterInventoryCapacity": 32,
}
```

The configuration uses `itemPatches` to define stack size rules based on tags or item IDs. Items are matched in top-down order, applying the operations of the first matching patch.

Each item has three stack sizes: general, player inventory, and mobile containers. Operations modify these sizes using numbers or references to container options like `{maxStackSize}`.

The `containerOptions` section sets general stack size limits for different container types. For example, `maxStackSize` applies to containers that don't fall under other specific container groups. Customize these limits as needed in the config file.

If `applyOnlyToStackables` is not specified, it defaults to true.

Refer to the config file for more details.
